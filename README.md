The reason is that a to-do list is a really nice example. At its most basic it is very simple
indeed — just a list of text strings — so it's easy to get a "minimum viable" list app up and
running. But it can be extended in all sorts of ways—different persistence models,
adding deadlines, reminders, sharing with other users, and improving the client-side
UI. There's no reason to be limited to just "to-do" lists either; they could be any kind of
lists. But the point is that it should allow me to demonstrate all of the main aspects of
web programming, and how you apply TDD to them.

Ultimately, programming is hard. Often, we are smart, so we succeed. TDD is there to
help us out when we’re not so smart. Kent Beck (who basically invented TDD) uses the
metaphor of lifting a bucket of water out of a well with a rope: when the well isn’t too
deep, and the bucket isn’t very full, it’s easy. And even lifting a full bucket is pretty easy
at first. But after a while, you’re going to get tired. TDD is like having a ratchet that lets
you save your progress, take a break, and make sure you never slip backwards. That way
you don’t have to be smart allthe time.

The reason is that a to-do list is a really nice example. At its most basic it is very simple
indeed — just a list of text strings — so it's easy to get a "minimum viable" list app up and
running. But it can be extended in all sorts of ways—different persistence models,
adding deadlines, reminders, sharing with other users, and improving the client-side
UI. There's no reason to be limited to just "to-do" lists either; they could be any kind of
lists. But the point is that it should allow me to demonstrate all of the main aspects of
web programming, and how you apply TDD to them.
